Welcome to MAL Client Upgraded's documentation!

.. warning::
    This documentation is currently undergoing maintenance and big changes, if you find any mistakes and/or errors please create PR's or issues on `project's github <https://github.com/ModerNews/MAL-API-Client-Upgraded>`_

This is official documentation for malclient-upgraded, I'm still working on it (especially enums require rework) but here's
pretty much everything you need to know about this wrapper

Installation
============

It's very simple, all you need to do is type:


``pip install malclient-upgraded``


Then, if you're new you should check out info on :doc:`authorizing with MyAnimeList REST API <Quickstart>`,
as it's quite complicated for new users.
